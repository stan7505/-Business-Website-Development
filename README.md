# -Business-Website-Development
design and build a website for a fictional small business. The website should be professional and user-friendly, providing visitors with information about the business, its services, contact details, and potentially, an online store.
HTML Structure:

The code starts with an HTML structure that includes metadata and links to external styles and JavaScript files.
There's a navigation bar at the top of the page, with a logo, search bar, and menu items.
Below the navigation, there is a product slider with images, titles, prices, and "Buy Now" buttons for different shoe products.
Following the slider, there are feature sections with icons and descriptions.
A single product view with details, such as title, price, description, color options, size options, and a "Buy Now" button.
A gallery section with images and titles.
A "New Season" section with images, titles, and a button.
"About Us" and "Contact Us" sections with textual content.
A footer section with various menu items, a newsletter subscription input, social media icons, and copyright information.
CSS:

The CSS styles are used to format and layout the HTML elements. It includes styles for the navigation, slider, product details, and other sections. There are responsive designs for different screen sizes, particularly for smaller screens where certain elements are hidden or displayed differently.
JavaScript:

JavaScript code manages the product slider functionality and updates the product details when a menu item is clicked. It also handles showing/hiding the payment information when the "Buy Now" button is clicked.
Functionality:

The product slider allows users to view different shoe products by clicking on the navigation menu items.
The product details are dynamically updated when a menu item is clicked, including the product title, price, and available colors and sizes.
When the "Buy Now" button is clicked, the payment information form is displayed, and it can be filled out.
The website is responsive and adapts its layout for smaller screens by modifying the navigation and hiding certain elements.
Note:

The code includes images and file paths for various resources (e.g., images and styles) that are not provided in the code snippet. To fully implement this code, you would need these resources available in your project.
